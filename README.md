# DCGAN-on-Butterfly
This project uses the DCGAN to generate butterfly images.  
The train dataset is in the [butterfly.rar](https://github.com/gg1036419175/DCGAN-on-Butterfly/blob/master/Butterfly.rar), as shown below.

These butterfly images were copied from the 《中国蝶类志》 by me，as a total of 3447 images and the size of the images is 96×96.
